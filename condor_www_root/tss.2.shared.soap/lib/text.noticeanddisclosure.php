NOTICE: A short term loan provides the cash needed to meet an
immediate short-term cash flow problem. It is not a solution
for longer term financial problems for which longer term
financing may be more appropriate. You may want to discuss your
financial situation with a nonprofit financial counseling
service in your community. You will be charged additional fees
if you renew the loan.

Arbitration of All Disputes: You and we agree that any and all
claims, disputes or controversies between you and us, any claim
by either of us against the other (or the employees, officers,
directors, agents, servicers or assigns of the other) and any
claim arising from or relating to your application for this
loan, regarding this loan or any other loan you previously or
may later obtain from us, this Note, this agreement to
arbitrate all disputes, your agreement not to bring, join or
participate in class actions, regarding collection of the loan,
alleging fraud or misrepresentation, whether under common law
or pursuant to federal, state or local statute, regulation or
ordinance, including disputes regarding the matters subject to
arbitration, or otherwise, shall be resolved by binding
individual (and not joint) arbitration by and under the Code of
Procedure of the National Arbitration Forum ("NAF") in effect
at the time the claim is filed. This agreement to arbitrate all
disputes shall apply no matter by whom or against whom the
claim is filed. Rules and forms of the NAF may be obtained and
all claims shall be filed at any NAF office, on the World Wide
Web at www.arb-forum.com, by telephone at 800-474-2371, or
at "National Arbitration Forum, P.O. Box 50191, Minneapolis,
Minnesota 55405." Your arbitration fees will be waived by the
NAF in the event you cannot afford to pay them. The cost of a
participatory hearing, if one is held at your or our request,
will be paid for solely by us and will take place at a location
near your residence. This arbitration agreement is made
pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce. It
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Sections 1-16. Judgment upon the award may be entered by any
party in any court having jurisdiction.

NOTICE: YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO
LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY
DECIDE THE DISPUTES BUT HAVE AGREED INSTEAD TO RESOLVE DISPUTES
THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION.

Agreement Not To Bring, Join Or Participate In Class Actions:
To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not
bring, join or participate in any class action as to any claim,
dispute or controversy you may have against us, our employees,
officers, directors, servicers and assigns. You agree to the
entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove
you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the
attorney's fees and court costs we incur in seeking such
relief. This agreement does not constitute a waiver of any of
your rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not
as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above.
This agreement not to bring, join, or participate in class
actions is an independent agreement and shall survive the
closing and repayment of the loan for which you are applying.

By submitting this Application you certify that all of the
information provided above is true, complete and correct and
provided to us for the purpose of inducing us to make the loan
for which you are applying. By submitting below you also agree
to the Agreement to Arbitrate All Disputes and the Agreement
Not To Bring, Join Or Participate in Class Actions. (This
Application will be deemed incomplete and will not be processed
by us unless signed by you.)
