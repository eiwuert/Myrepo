	<strong>Why we need your home phone number</strong>
	<p>Upon completing the online loan application, we may need to contact
		you for additional information in order to process your loan in a
		timely fashion.</p>
	<p>Where possible, we will contact you via email. In most cases
		we WILL NOT contact you at home in order to process your application.</p>

	<strong>Why we need to know your work phone</strong>
	<p>Like any lender, we are required to confirm your employment prior to sending your cash.
		Please be aware we DO NOT tell your employer you are applying for a cash advance.</p>
	<p>If you are not employed, but have regular income you can still qualify for a cash advance.
		Enter your home number in this field or leave it blank if you have benefits income and
		are not employed.</p>

	<strong>Why we need to know your monthly income</strong>
	<p>The amount you qualify for is determined by your personal and unique situation. A number of
		factors are considered in order to determine how much cash we can give you,
		including the amount of take home pay you receive monthly.</p>
	<p>PLEASE DO NOT OVERSTATE YOUR INCOME. Your income is verified when you send in your pay stub
		and bank statements. Overstating your income will result in delays in getting your cash to you.</p>
	<p>If you are not employed, but receive regular benefits income, please enter
		the amount you receive per month.</p>
	<p>You must have a net income of $1000 per month or benefits income of at least $800 per
		month to qualify for a cash advance.</p>

	<strong>Why we need to know how often you are paid</strong>
	<p>Knowing how often you are paid helps both you and us know when you will be able
		to re-pay your cash advance (either in full or service fees only, see your personal
		loan documents generated at the end of this application for exact details).</p>
	<p>If you are not employed, but receive benefits income, please let us know how often
		you receive your benefits income.</p>
