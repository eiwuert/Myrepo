	<strong>Why we need your date of birth</strong>
	<p>Your date of birth is required to establish your qualification
		for a cash advance. We cannot lend to individuals under the age
		of 18.</p>

	<strong>Why we ask for your mobile phone number</strong>
	<p>Providing a mobile number is strictly optional, however, we appreciate the
		urgency of your cash need. In the event that we need to contact you to speed
		up the loan process, it is often more convenient for you if we can reach you
		on your mobile phone.</p>

	<strong>Why we need your address</strong>
	<p>In order to protect you from fraudulent use of your personal information, we ask
		personal questions from you to ensure that you are, in fact, the person applying
		for the loan. Confirming where you live is one way we do this.</p>

	<strong>Why we need to know where you work</strong>
	<p>Employment or other source of regular income is a requirement to qualify for a cash advance.
		Like any lender, we are required to confirm your employment prior to sending your cash. However
		please be aware we DO NOT tell your employer you are applying for a cash advance.</p>
	<p>If you are not employed, but have regular income you can still qualify for a cash advance. Enter
		"Benefits" in this field if you have benefits income and are not employed.</p>

	<strong>Why we ask if you have worked or received benefits for at least three months</strong>
	<p>The amount you qualify for is determined by your personal and unique situation.
		A number of factors are considered in order to determine how much cash we can
		give you, including the length of time you have been employed or have received
		benefits.</p>
	<p>You are required to have worked at your current job, or received your current benefits
		for a period of at least three months in order to qualify for a cash advance.</p>

	<strong>Why we need your social security number</strong>
	<p>Your social security number is required in order to determine that you are in fact
		the person applying for this loan and to protect you from fraudulent use of your name
		and other personal data.</p>
