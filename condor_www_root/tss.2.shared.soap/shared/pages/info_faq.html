	<strong>What does it cost?</strong>
	<p>Cash advance loans are designed for emergency situations when you 
		are short of cash and need money fast! Family emergencies, unexpected 
		car repairs, overdrafts, telephone reconnection and deposits are just 
		some of the urgent cash needs our customers have experienced.</p>
	<p>Your fees are less than the cost of not having the cash you need when 
		you need it - overdraft fees, bounced check charges, taxes, even losing 
		your job because you can get to work! Actual fees are determined based 
		on the information you provide when you submit your loan application.</p>
	<p>Your cash can often be sent to your bank account the very next business 
		day and you don't repay until your next paycheck!</p>

	<strong>When do I get my money?</strong>
	<p>Once you have applied online, a loan agent will attempt to contact you to verify
		your information and explain the terms to you. Once you have spoken with your loan
		agent, your cash can be in your bank account as early as the next business day!</p>
	<p>And don't worry... any credit type can qualify, even bankruptcy, 
		charge-offs and bounced checks!</p>

	<strong>When do I repay?</strong>
	<p>Your repayment is the best part. The minimum required payment will be 
		deducted from your bank account. You get cash when you need it most 
		and repay when you have it!</p>
	<p>Still a little short on payday? No problem! Online customers are 
		automatically refinanced every pay period. Just let us know when you 
		are ready to pay in full, and we will deduct your loan plus fees from 
		your bank account.</p>

	<strong>I'm a little low on funds. Can I get an extension?</strong>
	<p>Customers are automatically refinanced, so you do not need to request it.</p>
	<p>If your next payday comes around and you are not as caught up 
		as you had planned, don't worry; we have it covered. We will 
		automatically extend your due date, and only deduct the refinance 
		fee from your checking account. Additional fees will apply,
		but you will be able to repay your cash advance from future paychecks.</p>
