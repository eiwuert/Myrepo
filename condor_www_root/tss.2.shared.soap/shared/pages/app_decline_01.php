		We understand your needs may be different from those you have automatically 
		qualified for via our online system. For example, our customers often make 
		the following requests:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>I wish to qualify for more money</li>		
			<li>I don't need that much</li>		
			<li>I will need to extend my loan or change the date which the online documents say I need to repay the loan</li>		
			<li>Other requests</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Your Loan Agent or Customer Service Representative can often address these 
		requests once your application has been completed and approved.</p>

		<p>To complete the process, please press &quot;I AGREE&quot;. An loan representative
		will be in touch shortly to complete the loan process.</p>

		<p>If you do not wish to proceed and you do not wish to receive the cash you 
		have qualified for, please press &quot;I DO NOT AGREE&quot;. Pressing 
		&quot;I DO NOT AGREE&quot; will immediately terminate your loan application 
		and no further action will be taken.</p>
