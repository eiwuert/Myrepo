***************************** INSTRUCTIONS ****************************

	- Every change that has been commited to the CVS repository should
		have a corresponding entry in this file: if it's been committed,
		then it has the potentital to go live. Listing the change in here
		helps prevent changes that are not ready to be pushed live from
		inadvertantly being included in a release.

	- Your initials MUST be included with your changes. If they are not,
		you will be hunted down and burned at the stake. And possibly
		eaten, cannibal style, with a little pepper.

	- All changes should be grouped by feature addition or bug fix, and
		list ALL modified files for that change. In general, any change
		that affects more than one file should not be grouped with ANY
		other change. Conversely, a small change that affected one file
		should not be piggie-backed onto an entry that includes more than
		that one file. If there are several small bug fixes all affecting
		the same file, then they can be listed together. However, bug fixes
		should not be grouped with a feature addition, unless the fix was
		required for proper operation.

	- Entries should follow this format:

				files/that/were/changed.php
				another/file/that/was/changed_as_well.php

			1. Short description of the feature addition [YOUR INITIALS]
			2. Had to fix a small bug to get this to work [INITIALS]

	- Add entries to the PENDING CHANGES section. As changes are released,
		they will be moved to the current/previous release sections, under
		their corresponding release, by the release manager.
