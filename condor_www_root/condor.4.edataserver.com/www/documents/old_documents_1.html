		<b>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</b>  We may collect &quot;nonpublic personal information&quot; about you from the following sources:

					This Authorization becomes effective at the 
					time we make you the loan for which you are applying and will remain in 
					full force and effect until we have received notice of revocation from 
					you. It does not authorize us to make debit entries with regard to any 
					other loan. You may revoke this authorization to effect an ACH debit entry 
					to your Account by giving written notice of revocation to us, which must 
					be received no later than 3 business days prior to the due date of you 
					loan. However, if you timely revoke this authorization to effect ACH debit 
					entries before the loan is paid in full, you authorize us to prepare and 
					submit one or more checks drawn on your Account on or after the due date 
					of your loan. This authorization to prepare and submit a check on your 
					behalf may not be revoked by you until such time as the loan is paid in 
					full.

			</li>
			<li>You must provide us with a blank check from your checking

				<b>Payment Options:</b>
					<ol type="a" class="norm2">
						<li>Refinance. Your loan will be refinanced 
							on every* due date unless you notify us of your desire 
							to pay in full or to pay down your principle amount borrowed. 
							You will accrue a new fee every time your loan is refinanced. 
							Any fees accrued will not go toward the principle amount owed.
							<br />
							*On your fifth refinance and every refinance thereafter, 
							your loan will be paid down by $50.00. This means your 
							account will be debited for the finance charge plus $50.00, 
							this will continue until your loan is paid in full.
						</li>
						<li>Pay Down. You can pay down 
							your principle amount by increments of $50.00. Paying
							down will decrease the fee charge for refinance. To accept 
							this option you must notify us of your request in writing 
							via fax at 
							(800)256-9166, 
							at least three full business days before your loan is due.
						</li>
						<li>Pay Out. You can payout your full balance, 
							the principle plus the fee for that period. To accept 
							this option you must notify us of your request in writing 
							via fax at 
							(800)256-9166.
							The request must be received at least three full business
							days before your loan is due.
